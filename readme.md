* In some places you can see different practices of writing the same code, for example mapper or logging, this is just for demonstration

* For logging and statistics, it was possible to offer the ELK stack and Grafana with Prometheus, but I implemented a lower-level approach. It would be more flexible for me

* I also encountered a lot of misunderstandings in the conditions

* For get this project you need just to start docker-compose file after this start old-system spring-boot project and finally new-system.

* Have a nice day! üíù
